Step 1: (Due 09/06/2018 @11:30PM)

Requirements: (Form a group of no more than three students (10%))

Group members:
 
•	Alexander Reimer, Eric Thompson & Robert Gelly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: (Due 09/25/2018 @11:30PM)

Requirements: (Choose a project from the text book or propose your own project, must be approved by the instructor (10%))

Group Project Idea: Student Class Enrollment System GUI

•	The main idea of the program we would like to create is a program designed for class enrollment for a student. We would like to create something like the eservices site that we currently use to enroll in school but do so from a GUI and not an online interface. The program will allow the student to enroll, disenroll/modify their schedule as well as get course information (requirements, books, etc.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: (Due 10/16/2018 @11:30PM)

Requirements: (Meet with instructor to go over the project’s specifications and requirements. In this step you can present the pseudocode, flowchart, or UML diagram of your project. Also, you should list the features that you will implement by Step 4 due date (10%))

Some of the features we would like to implement in this program are the following:

•	Allow a student to enroll into school and have a student ID/email and password.

•	Allow student to enroll/disenroll/modify/search classes

•	Allow the student to see and get the required books/materials for classes they are enrolled in

•	Allow student to get a TXT file back with all information on up-coming schedule (Classes, times, teacher, room number, etc.)

• If a course is full, allow the student to add the course to a wish list.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: (Due 11/06/2018 @11:30PM)

Requirement: (Meet with the instructor to go over your code – code review. In this step, demo the implemented features presented in Step 3. Also, you should have your GitHub account created and your project added into it. (10%))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5: (Due 11/27/2018 @11:30PM)

Requirements: (Meet with the instructor to go over your code – code review. In this step, you should have at least 90% of your project implemented. Share your project’s repository (GitHub URL) with the instructor to check your progress (10%))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6: (Due 12/11/2018 @11:30PM)

Requirements: (Present your Final project in front of the class. Your presentation should be around 10 minutes long. This is the project that compiles and runs correctly and meets the requirements presented in Step 3 (50%))
