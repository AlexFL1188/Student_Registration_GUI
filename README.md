Group Project Idea: Student Class Enrollment System GUI

•	The main idea of the program we would like to create is a program designed for class enrollment for a student. We would like to create something like the eservices site that we currently use to enroll in school but do so from a GUI and not an online interface. The program will allow the student to enroll, disenroll/modify their schedule as well as get course information (requirements, books, etc.)

Some of the features we would like to implement in this program are the following:

•	Allow a student to enroll into school and have a student ID and email.

•	Allow student to enroll/disenroll/modify classes

•	Allow the student to see and get the required books/materials for classes they are enrolled in

•	Allow student to get a file back with all information on up-coming schedule (Classes, times, teacher, room number, etc.)
